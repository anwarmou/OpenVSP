This directory contains all python tests for pyvspaero.

To run all of the tests use the following command:

  $ testflo .

But if your name's Daniel and `testflo` doesn't work for you, do it this way:

  $ python -m unittest <test_foo.py>

where `<test_foo.py>` is one of the Python files that start with `test_`.
